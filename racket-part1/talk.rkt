 #:title "Promo"

 (para "This is VTFun's first Racket or Scheme talk, but instead of a tutorial, I'm planning a tour of a few key ideas from the 1950s to the present that every programmer should grok, and no language designer should ignore. I hope that each slide will be easy to follow, seem obvious in retrospect, and maybe make you a better programmer."))

 (para "About the Presenter: Anthony Carrico earned a master's degree in electrical and computer engineering, primarily in signal processing and computer architecture. He tried to learn to code at an AI company heated with Lisp and Unix machines. He went on to program Japanese music video games. His wife teaches at St. Mike's and he stays home with the kids."))

 (item "Understand Xxx Style in terms of abstraction over primitives before adding sugar. (Hmm, I'll credit Friedman this time).")

 (item "Worse may be better in the short term, but pay attention to the communities that cultivate best practices over the long term.")

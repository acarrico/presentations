                    Let's Get Cozy with Relations

You probably first heard the term "relation" when you were 10 years
old. Did you embrace it? I wish I had.

I plan to:

  * sneak up on the term through iconic hacker culture (of course!)

  * look relations straight in the eye

  * check out slippery nearby terms like predicate, function,
    procedure, and (maybe not) abstraction (that's another talk!)

  * say a tiny bit, but almost nothing about SQL and logic
    programming, and a little bit about other problem solving
    approaches

  * show a practical application: graphics

  * show a theoretical application: (shudder) semantics

On the practical side, if you are a day-to-day programmer, I think
this talk will knock you sideways into a fresh perspective on your
work. On the theoretical side, getting cozy with relations has really
helped me approach the heavier VTFun talks, and that middle section of
the "Papers We Love" that you really just want to skip, and so many
things I've supposedly learned, but never really grokked.

About the Presenter: Anthony Carrico earned a master's degree in
electrical and computer engineering, primarily in signal processing
and computer architecture. He tried to learn to code at an AI company
heated with Lisp and Unix machines. He went on to program Japanese
music video games. His wife teaches at St. Mike's, and he currently
gets to stay home with the kids. His last presentation for VTFun was
confusingly called "Pay Attention to Racket", but "Expressions" would
have been a much more accurate title.

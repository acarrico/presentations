Here was the promo:

This is VTFun's first Racket or Scheme talk, but instead of a
tutorial, I'm planning a tour of a few key ideas from the 1950s to the
present that every programmer should grok, and no language designer
should ignore. I hope that each slide will be easy to follow, seem
obvious in retrospect, and maybe make you a better programmer.

About the Presenter: Anthony Carrico earned a master's degree in
electrical and computer engineering, primarily in signal processing
and computer architecture. He tried to learn to code at an AI company
heated with Lisp and Unix machines. He went on to program Japanese
music video games. His wife teaches at St. Mike's and he stays home
with the kids.

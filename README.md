[VT Functional Programmers: Anthony Carrico, *Pay Attention to Racket*](http://www.meetup.com/VTCode/events/144677752/)

This talk has a little Racket, but is mostly about John McCarthy, lisp,
and Algol60 (I've come to think of it as the *expressions* talk).

Video now available here: https://vimeo.com/77754412

NOTE: If anyone wants to preprocess the audio, or sync up the audio and slides
go ahead and fork this repo! It is in the public domain. I have 4-ch flac audio
available (but it is big).

I wanted to get the raw audio up today in memory of John McCarthy!
I previewed the talk ogg+pdf and it sounds
pretty good on headphones (I noticed a few mistakes, but oh well!), could use
some compression, downmix to mono, and trimming.

Talk starts about 7-8min in.

Here was the promo:

This is VTFun's first Racket or Scheme talk, but instead of a
tutorial, I'm planning a tour of a few key ideas from the 1950s to the
present that every programmer should grok, and no language designer
should ignore. I hope that each slide will be easy to follow, seem
obvious in retrospect, and maybe make you a better programmer.

About the Presenter: Anthony Carrico earned a master's degree in
electrical and computer engineering, primarily in signal processing
and computer architecture. He tried to learn to code at an AI company
heated with Lisp and Unix machines. He went on to program Japanese
music video games. His wife teaches at St. Mike's and he stays home
with the kids.
